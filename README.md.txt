This is a simple sudoku solver I made in Java.

The usage is simple: Create a text file that represents a board you are trying to solve with each number separated by a space, and each unknown marked as a number less than or equal to zero (use zero for easiest human visualization)

Example:
1 2 3 4 0 6 7 8 0

0 5 0 0 0 0 1 2 0

0 0 9 1 2 3 4 5 0

0 3 4 5 6 7 0 9 1

0 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 0

8 0 1 0 0 4 5 6 0

3 0 0 6 0 8 0 1 2

6 7 8 9 0 2 3 0 5

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


The Sudoku Solver will attempt to solve the board by generating a list of available integers for each position.  After that, it will fill in any position that only has one possible value.  This cycle continues until the board is complete or the maximum number of specified iterations is reached.
